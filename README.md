### Hi there 👋
My name's Derek Belloni. I started coding during the Covid-19 pandemic as a way to pass the time and before I knew it I was enrolling at Boise Code Works in their full stack engineering program. The joy that comes from facing and overcoming whatever coding challenges come my way is extremely gratifying and I am excited to program as a full time career. 

Fast forward too nearly two years later, I am employed as a web dev and genuinely love it (most of the time). Funny how much I thought I knew when I first filled this read me out....
