### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Derek Belloni. I started coding during the Covid-19 pandemic as a way to pass the time and before I knew it I was enrolling at Boise Code Works in their full stack engineering program. The joy that comes from facing and overcoming whatever coding challenges come why is extremely gratifying and I am excited to program as a full time career. Until now, my working career has been in the culinary industry but coding taps into my creativity in a way food never did.
